# Plant Disease Detection

## Overview
The Plant Disease Detection project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify diseases in plant leaves based on images. This deep learning model analyzes leaf images to detect potential diseases, providing an efficient solution for farmers, gardeners, and researchers to monitor plant health.

## Features
- Classifies plant leaf images as healthy or diseased.
- Identifies the type of disease affecting the plant.
- Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
#### Libraries:
- numpy
- pickle-mixin
- streamlit
- seaborn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit_learn
- tensorflow
- keras
- opencv_python_headless
